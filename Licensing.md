Jabber-Net source code licensing
================================

Jabber-Net
----------

The core source code is licensed under the terms of LGPLv3 license, see
[licenses/Jabber-Net_LGPLv3.txt][jabber-net] for details.

It's copyrighted by Cursive Systems, Inc. in 2002â€”2008; from 2008 it was altered
by some independent contributors and it's safe to assume that these
contributions are copyrighted by them.

Original author (Joe Hildebrand) asked the library users to don't make a
commercial XMPP servers using the library, but unambigiously put no legal
restrictions on that.

LGPLv3 is the main license for the project; all the new contributions are
licensed under the terms of this license.

### History

Previous versions of Jabber-Net at various times were available under the terms
of [Jabber Open Source License (JOSL)][josl] and [GPLv2][gplv2].

### Source tagging policy

Current project maintainers are not happy with explicitly naming the licenses in
headers of every source file (expecially because there're some source code
formats that disallow such headers), so we state the following the policy
regarding the license headers ([like this][header-sample]):

1.  Leave the headers as-is on their places in the source code. They're just
    mentioning some facts that are known to be true (the code is indeed licensed
    by the mentioned authors in the mentioned years; the code is indeed licensed
    under the terms of the mentioned license/licenses; all the rights are
    definitely reserved).
2.  Change the license file names in the headers correspondingly when moving the
    license files (so the reader won't be confused if the license files are
    moved).
3.  Do not change the headers in any way: don't add any additional copyright
    notices (they aren't required to claim the copyright as a code author);
    don't change the copyright years.
4.  Don't add any headers in the new files; placing this `Licensing.md` file in
    the root of the source code package should be enough.

"either JOSL or the GPL"-licensed files
---------------------------------------

There's a bunch of files marked as licensed under the terms of "either JOSL or
the GPL". Probably that's just some old sources that were never converted to the
new license by the Cursive Systems, Inc., but the best choice we have today is
to follow the restrictions mentioned in the sources.

These files will be removed ASAP before the next release. Please follow
[Jabber-Net#34][issue-34] to track the progress and get the full file list.

netlib.Dns
----------

[netlib.Dns][netlib-dns] project is copyrighted by "The ASP Emporium
(http://www.aspemporium.com/)" whose site is currently unavailable. We assume
that it has the same license as Jabber-Net itself, because its source code was
found in the same repository as Jabber-Net with no explicit license marks, so it
has to be covered by the [main Jabber-Net license file][jabber-net].

UNICODE
-------

Portions of [stringprep.unicode][stringprep-unicode] namespace contains data
published by UNICODE, INC. under the terms of [UNICODE, INC. LICENSE
AGREEMENT][unicode].

xpnet
-----

[xpnet][] namespace is currently an integral part of Jabber-Net. It's
copyrighted by its author in 1997 and 1998 under the terms of modified MIT
license. See the full license text at [licenses/xpnet_MIT.txt][xpnet-mit].
